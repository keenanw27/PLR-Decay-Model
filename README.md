# PLR-Decay-Model
Model of negative-feedback's impact on pupil constriction through time.
There are four files here. (1) is the matlab code (PLRmodel.m). (2) is a file containing the light intensities upon which the model is run (Lux.mat). (3) is a file containing the wildtype transient dose-reponse curve values which the model uses to demonstrate the impact of negative-feedback on pupil maintanence (DRC RPA.mat). (4) is a time weightning vector generated by a 1s light pulse-chase experiment in order to incorporate approximate kinetics of negative-feedback's impact into the model (Weights.mat)
